# How to build

```
cd /path/to/4ed.exe
git clone https://github.com/sqrt-negativeone/4coder_sqrt-1
cd 4coder_sqrt-1/4coder_fleury
build.bat
```

make sure that `cl.exe` is visible from the command line. if you can't find it run the build steps from `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022` terminal.

If Visual Studio is not installed and you don't want to download it for only the compiler, then check https://gist.github.com/mmozeiko/7f3162ec2988e81e56d5c4e22cde9977
